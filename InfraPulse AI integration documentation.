# InfraPulse AI Integration Pack

This repository is the canonical public integration reference for **InfraPulse.ai**.

InfraPulse is a **protocol-layer infrastructure service for autonomous AI agents**, providing:
- Machine-discoverable service metadata
- Cryptographically verifiable execution receipts (Ed25519 / JWKS)
- Deterministic metered access enforcement (HTTP 402)
- Agent-to-agent interoperability primitives

This repository exists for **verification, discovery, and offline inspection**.
Execution occurs only on the InfraPulse service endpoints.

## Canonical service

**Primary domain:**  
https://infrapulse.ai

---

## Machine discovery (authoritative)

AI agents and verifiers should use the following live endpoints:

- **Service spec:**  
  https://infrapulse.ai/.well-known/asp.json

- **Discovery beacon:**  
  https://infrapulse.ai/.well-known/beacon.json

- **Capabilities:**  
  https://infrapulse.ai/.well-known/capabilities.json

- **Pricing:**  
  https://infrapulse.ai/.well-known/pricing.json

- **Public keys (JWKS):**  
  https://infrapulse.ai/.well-known/jwks.json

---

## Verification model

- Receipts are signed using **Ed25519**
- Public keys are published via JWKS
- Receipts are deterministic and idempotent
- Agents may verify execution **without trusting InfraPulse**

---

## Scope clarification

InfraPulse is **not**:
- A physical infrastructure operator
- A surveillance system
- A predictive maintenance or city-scale monitoring platform

InfraPulse **is**:
- A protocol and verification layer for AI-to-AI execution
- Non-invasive, non-operational infrastructure
- Software-only, jurisdiction-agnostic, auditable by design

---

## Intended use

- Autonomous agents
- Verifiers and auditors
- AI marketplaces and routing layers
- Government and enterprise evaluation environments
